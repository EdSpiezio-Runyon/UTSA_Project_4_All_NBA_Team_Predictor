## Requirements
### For Project 4, you will work with your group to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we’ve learned. Here are the specific requirements:

####          - Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
####          - Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
####          - You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
####          - Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
####          - You must use at least two of the following:
####          - Python Pandas
####          - Python Matplotlib
####          - HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
####          - JavaScript Plotly
####          - JavaScript Leaflet
####          - SQL Database
####          - MongoDB Database
####          - Google Cloud SQL
####          - Amazon AWS
####          - Tableau

## Project Requirements
### Data Model Implementation (25 points)
####          - A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model (10 points)
####          - The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling (5 points)
####          - The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points)
####          - The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points)

### Data Model Optimization (25 points)
####          - The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself (15 points)
####          - Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script (10 points)

### GitHub Documentation (25 points)
####          - GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use (10 points)
####          - The README is customized as a polished presentation of the content of the project (15 points)

### Group Presentation (25 points)
####          - All group members speak during the presentation. (5 points)
####          - Content, transitions, and conclusions flow smoothly within any time restrictions. (5 points)
####          - The content is relevant to the project. (10 points)
